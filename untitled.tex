In this experiment we will study the attenuation of beta particles in aluminium, using a radioactive source and a Geiger counter detector. 

The source used is strontium-$90$ ($^{90}$Sr) which has an activity of $5\,\mu$Ci\footnote{The curie (Ci) is an old-fashioned but convenient measure of radioactivity and indicates the number of decays per unit time. The more modern SI unit of radioactivity is the becquerel (Bq), which corresponds to $1$ decay per second. The conversion between the two units is $1\,\mu\textrm{Ci} = 37,000\,\textrm{Bq} = 37\,\textrm{kBq}$.}

Strontium-$90$ undergoes $\beta^{-}$ decay into yttrium-$90$ with decay energy $0.546$ MeV and half-life $28.79$ years. Each decay emits an electron ($\mathrm{e}^-$)  and an electron anti-neutrino ($\overbar{\nu_\mathrm{e}}$).

Neutrinos have negligible probability of interacting with matter. Electrons, however, lose kinetic energy as they interact electromagnetically with matter. So, they can only travel a certain distance before they come to rest.
