In this experiment we will study the absorption of beta particles in aluminium, using a radioactive source and a Geiger counter detector. The source we are using is strontium-$90$ ($^{90}$Sr) which has an activity of $5 \mu$Ci. 

Strontium-$90$ undergoes $\beta^{-}$ decay into yttrium-$90$ with decay energy $0.546$ MeV and half-life $28.79$ years. Each decay emits and electron ($\mathrm{e}^-$) and an electron anti-neutrino ($\overbar{\nu_\mathrm{e}}$).

The curie (Ci) is an old-fashioned but convenient measure of radioactivity and indicates the number of decays per unit time. The more modern SI unit of radioactivity is the becquerel (Bq), which corresponds to $1$ decay per second. The conversion between the two units is 
\begin{displaymath}
  1\,\mu\textrm{Ci} = 37,000\,\textrm{Bq} = 37\,\textrm{kBq} 
\end{displaymath}
So, our source decays at a rate of $5\times37,000=185,000$ decays per second.
