\subsection{Uncertainties}

Radioactivity is a random process in the sense that it is not possible to predict when the next decay will occur. However, radioactivity has a mean rate of decay, which depends on the source atom. This mean rate will imply a mean rate of detections (counts) per unit time.

In this second experiment, we would like to measure how well can we estimate the mean count rate, and how our precision depends on the number of counts we accumulate.
